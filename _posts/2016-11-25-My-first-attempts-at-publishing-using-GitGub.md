  <tr>
    <td>At first I set up my account with the wrong email, so I had to restart but this was fine as it didn't take very long to do. Talking to other people also helped as we could share knowledge and help each other, but this can also be distracting as you can't focus as much. Also I should try to meme her the notes more as I often forgot what to do, which slowed me down.</td>

    <td>Next time I will focus more when notes are given out so I can remember them more easily. I also should not get distracted by other people and try to work more independently. </td>
