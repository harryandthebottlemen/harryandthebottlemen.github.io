HERE IS THE LINK TO THE QUIZ: [https://repl.it/HiCF/2](https://repl.it/HiCF/2)

I have finished my quiz. This is a random quiz which shows how i have managed to give an answer to a certain person and also calculate percentage change. Much simpler things like showing text and getting a reply and also in it, this really shows how far i have come as at first i couldn't do this.

During the year i also learnt lots in making this blog. I have discovered how much work it takes to customize and develop a blog, which works well and looks pretty good. I got help from other people and looked online as well as trying new stuff on my own to create my blog which i have changed lots. 

We also used sheets which was a good way to begin coding, the simple way. This was very usefull to create my repl.it and my blog.
