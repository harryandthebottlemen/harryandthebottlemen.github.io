This lesson I restarted my blog and added lots from before I knew what to do. I had changed my look and name as well as how it worked. This improved it a lot. This lesson I worked hard and managed to complete lots in the lesson. I blocked out distractions to do this and managed to complete it. 

I used many similar things from before as i knew how to do it. This let me complete it fast and finish my blog. I also added a picture to check if it was working. I am now ready to post and continue my learning.
