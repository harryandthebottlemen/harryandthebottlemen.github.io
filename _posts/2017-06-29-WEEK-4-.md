This lesson i developed my github so it gave more options. I also fixed it more. I added a revision section so it's a fun tool to revise with. I reached my target as i had developed it more and added new stuff. I changed it by adding and taking away during the lesson.

I blacked out distractions and work hard to complete my task. I also added back up my weeks2 as this got deleted.
