    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I knew nothing about sheets and how to do it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this </td>
    <td>To set up shop and be able to calculate price.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, i finished it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I listened to what was being said and asked questions on how to do parts. This let me complete the task and be able to calculate the price from how many was sold. I made a few mistakes but by asking questions I completed the task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was very focused this lesson and got the job done. I did send a wile on finding the items and this led me to rush part of the formula, but i did fix it and it works well now. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will focus more on the actual learning and not the items as much. I still did it and maybe next time i could get the actual price of the items and this will be more realistic than it is now. </td>
  </tr>
