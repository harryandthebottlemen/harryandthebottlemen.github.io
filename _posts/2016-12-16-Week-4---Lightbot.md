  <tr>
    <td>I learned that to complete to task I must complete it in the shortest way possible. If i didn't do this I would end up with too many commands. After this I would re-do it and debug what I had done. I listened to the instructions provided and used this to complete the task.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I often used the wrong arrow when turning. This caused my whole code to to work. I also sometimes i missed out code which caused it to all go wrong. When using Proc 1 and 2, this taught me how to use less space which improved my learning as i could fit it all in, and code less.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will check before i start to command as i will be able to see where i went wrong before i go wrong. This will develop my learning as it will be better at spotting mistakes. This will improve my blog as i can use it to find mistakes in the code.</td>
