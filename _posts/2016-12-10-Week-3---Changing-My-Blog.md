    <td>I had my blog, with a background and a basic look.</td>

    <td>Target for this </td>
    <td>To edit the blog further and change text.</td>

    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No, I had lots of help but no one could complete it. </td>

    <td>This lesson I listened to the demonstration and therefore changed my work by using this. This let me add shadows to text boxes and making them transparent. I also tried to change my text. After working on my own for ages I asked for help from a teacher. After two teachers helping for a while, and trying many things, we could change the text. After this I removed the white bar at the bottom of the blog.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson I became stuck on changing the text. This did take up lots of time, but let me explore more parts of the blog. This led me to discover how to change what the text looks like. Also trial and error worked well, but I think I should focus more on this as I became annoyed and stopped trying.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will seek help earlier as this will let me make progress on other parts of the blog as I was wasting lots of time on this and if I had seeped help faster I would have realized it isn't possible and I would have moved on. At the end I asked him to do something and got the answer fast and this let me move on faster and complete more of my blog.</td>
