This week were were set a starter to make a repel.it thing that gives feedback on your name length. This took up almost the whole lesson. At first i made a simple structure that worked very well. It just gave a bit of information on your name. 

Then i attempted to make it more complicated. This had many different feedback things and would have worked really well. But it didn't work. I then tried to get it back but couldn't. For some reason it didn't work and i couldn't get it back. This was good as it showed i can do it but next time i need to be more careful when changing so i don't lose work and spend ages trying to get it back or make another.
