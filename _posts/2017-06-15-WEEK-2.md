This lesson i continued to change my blog. I attempted but failed to change the font. However, I changed the size of some boxes and the colour and fade of them as well. This gave a more simple look to the blog and made it look more professional. Next i added a video. This showed some of my learning from last term even though i needed a bit of help.

This lesson i worked well and also tried out some quizes i could try to produce next lesson. This gave me a target to have my blog working well by next lesson so i can do this. My blog now works well and i can post all the posts i need to.
