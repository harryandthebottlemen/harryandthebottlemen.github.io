  <tr>
    <td>I looked on the internet when i was stuck. This gave me more time to try and figure out other parts of it. This lead me to find the code with some help. I started trying to add this to me code, but i did not complete in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was stuck looking on incorrect websites and this took up lots of time. I also tried lots of websites that didn't work, but this lead me to develop me learning, and finally finding the correct code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will finish adding the code and ask for a clue on where to look earlier, as this would have lead me to be able to finish my work.</td>
